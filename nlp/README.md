# Note:
- The csv files in the assests directory are examples. Otherwise the full training and evaluation data are too large for GitHub.
- The Classification model must be created. It is not stored in this repo because it can be quite large in memory.

# To create the model, run the following in the terminal in this project's directory:

```console 
python -m spacy project run all
```
